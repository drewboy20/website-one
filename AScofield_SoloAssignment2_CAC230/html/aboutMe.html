          <p style="font-size: large; line-height: 1.5;">Hello! I am Andrew Scofield! <br> <br>
            I am a student at Birmingham-Southern College and a computer science major there.
            You might be surprised that I am not a music major because I have decided to make 
            a website based on music theory. Well, to give a bit of backstory to myself, music 
            has always been a dear hobby and therapeutic pastime that I have found myself returning 
            to more and more frequently over the past year. I have always been around music ever 
            since I can remember. My brother is a classically trained pianist currently playing and 
            teaching in Houston, Texas, my mother is a trained and experienced vocalist who has 
            previously toured with several college and professional choirs, and my father grew up 
            in the seventies music heyday when every young man felt obligated to play guitar and be 
            in some sort of band. You could say music is in my genes. <br> <br>
            I was not always interested in music theory and I did not always play a musical instrument.
             I tried to play piano growing up, but I think I was frustrated that I couldn't play 
             Rachmaninoff within two weeks of starting! I really wish I had kept on playing even if I 
             didn't find it to be all that entertaining because having the discipline of learning an 
             instrument is a valuable skill to have.
            But the story continues from there because about 3 or 3 1/2 years ago I started veering away 
            from modern pop songs into more "classic" music of the '60s and '70s. Mesmerized with the 
            likes of Jimi Hendrix, Jimmy Page, and Stevie Ray Vaughn I decided I was going to teach 
            myself how to play guitar. So I dusted off my father's 1975 Guild D25 acoustic guitar and 
            taught myself the basic "cowboy" chords. <br> <br>
            
            From that point, I caught the fever of playing an instrument and I have never turned back.
             A majority I have learned about music theory I have taught myself, and now I have fulfilled 
             my mother's wish and I have joined the Birmingham-Southern concert and a cappella choirs.</p>
